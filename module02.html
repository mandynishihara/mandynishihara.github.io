<h1>HTML: Tables, Forms, Extra Markup</h1>
<hr>

<b>Summary of Content:</b> In module 2, we went over the basic tags to produce tables, forms, and applying the DOCTYPE tag. 
 For the tables, we learned attributes such as, "rowspan" and "colspan" to merge cells together
  and "border/style" to change the look. With the forms, there were different input types that we could use 
  for the many different options when filling out a form.

<p>
<b>Personal Reflection:</b> Personally, I enjoyed making the tables more than the forms. 
  I felt like the forms were a little harder to do but I did find myself getting 
  stuck on some of the tables.
