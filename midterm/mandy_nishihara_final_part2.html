<h1>Final Questions:</h1>
<br>

<b><li>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript</li></b>
Previously, I had no knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript. <br><br>


<b><li>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?</li></b>
I used the website example from the module 4 assignment and changed the <br>layout based on the content of the page.
<br><br>


<b><li>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)</li></b>
The most challenging part was making the layout for my artifact and validator page. It <br>took me a while to size the pictures and position them to how I wanted it.


<br><br>
<b><li>How taking this class changed your view on Web Development? </li></b>
I've never really thought about Web Development until I decided to take this class.<br> When I signed up for the class I wasn't thinking a whole lot about what <br>exactly Web Development was other than it sounding interesting.


<br><br>
<b><li>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</li></b>
I would recommend getting a "head start" on your assignments and not procrastinating. <br>You'd often find yourself stuck on a problem and for me, it helps to come back later to fix it. <br>I would also recommend having fun. Experiment with tags to see what works, <br>it's sorta like a trial and error.
