<h1>Introduction to Web Development #1</h1>
<hr>

<b>Summary of Content:</b> In module 01 we learned the basics of web development. We went over what tags are and how some come in pairs, how to arrange text, add images, and link pages/references on our website. 

<p>
<b>Personal Reflection:</b> I find web development to be very time consuming. This is something that's new to me and I hope to get the hang of it but overall I enjoyed doing the assignments.
